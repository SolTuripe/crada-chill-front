# Crada&Chill 🍿

## Introduction 📼

The Crada&Chill project is a web application for recommending movies. You will be able to see a gallery of movies with their rating and you will be able to add new movies.

## Objectives of the practice 🎬

We introduce ourselves a bit in the Spring Boot and React framework making a CRUD-style Microservice.

- Users will be able to add a movie with an image, title, genre, director name and score
- Users will be able to edit the cards
- Users will be able to delete the cards

## Starting 📹

In this repository we create the User Interface for our Crada&Chill project
